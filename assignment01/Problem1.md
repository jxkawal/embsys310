Using the telegraph example, and the challenges listed in the module as reference, and describe another device that you would like to discuss. Describe how you think its embedded system works, and what design challenges it presents.

Another embedded device is the Ignition Control Module in a car.  This unit is responsible for receiving signals from the crankshaft position sensor and the camshaft position sensor, and for providing voltages to the ignition coils so that the spark plugs can fire at exactly the correct time.

Clearly this system has a very hard time contraint.  The timing of a spark plug firing must be extremely precise.  Too early and your engine will knock, too late and your power and performance will suffer.

This system must also be extremely reliable - as soon as it stops working your car is dead - and it's not servicable or repairable.  If it fails it must be replaced.

The device must also have a low cost as the manufacturer wants the cost of mass producing the car to be as low as possible.
