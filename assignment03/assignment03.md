Problems:
1. This is complete and the code can be found as the file "led1_blink.c".

2. In the file referenced above, the XOR bitwise operator is used to toggle the LED.

3. a. Morse Code is a communication system that encodes letters into a series of "dots" and "dashes", where dots a short pulse (of something like light or sound) and dashes are long pulses.
	b. Samuel Morse was a co-developer of Morse code.  It was used to transmit messages over telegraph lines.

4.	The code for this program can be found as the file "morse_code_name.c".  A video is also found in the same directory, which shows the code blinking "JASON".
	
5. The CubeMx tool generated code that blinks LED1 can be found as the file "led1_blink_cube_generated.c".
